# TODO: Add Hardcoded User to Bypass Login

- [x] Edit login.php to add a hardcoded check for username 'testuser' and password 'testpass' before the database query. If matched, set session variables and redirect to user_home.php.
- [x] Test the login with hardcoded credentials to ensure it bypasses the database check.
